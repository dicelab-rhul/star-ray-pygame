# `star-ray-pygame`

A [star-ray](https://github.com/dicelab-rhul/star-ray) extension that implements a [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) [Avatar](). 
An `avatar` is an agent that represents an external user in a `star-ray` simulation. 
The `avatar` displays a UI, rendering Scalable-Vector-Graphics to a `pygame` window, captures input (clicks, keys, etc.), allowing the user to interact with other agents in the simulation.
